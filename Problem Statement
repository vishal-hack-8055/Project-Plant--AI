Points to implement:

👉🏻 Climate control: AI adjusts temperature, humidity, and light to mimic your plant's natural habitat.

👉🏻 Soil management: Built-in sensors monitor and optimize nutrients and moisture levels.

👉🏻 Health monitoring: AI analyzes plant data to detect and prevent problems before they arise.
